# ARKitDemoPlayground
A demo of the ARKit Demo project from Xcode 9 as a Swift Playground

This is nothing special, in fact, it's the sample project that comes with Xcode 9 for checking out ARKit with SpriteKit. Only I chucked it into a playground.

More info on ARKit:

* [Beta downloads at developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/download/) - You need Swift Playgrounds 2 beta, which you can request here
