# ARKitDemoPlayground
A demo of the ARKit Demo project from Xcode 9 as a Swift Playground

This is nothing special, in fact, it's the sample project that comes with Xcode 9 for checking out ARKit with SpriteKit. Only I chucked it into a playground.

More info on ARKit:
* [ARKit - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/) - the landing page for ARKit at Apple
* [Beta downloads at developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/download/) - You need Swift Playgrounds 2 beta, which you can request here 
* [ARKit Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit) - the ARKit developer docs

The `master` branch now includes all the code in one file so you can tweak the distance from the sample ARKit code in your Swift Playgrounds app. If you'd like the old behavior, check out the [`original`](https://github.com/mhanlon/ARKitDemoPlayground/tree/original) branch.
